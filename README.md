# learn_git
Trail run on learning git and github.

Successfully closed the remote repo on this directory by using the cmd <git remote rm origin>

after which I scanned the directory to make sure the git repo was still active on that directory by using <git status> or <ls -a> to see if the .git file was still there. 

I then followed the instrution on github to connect the remote repo with my local git.
